class PolynomialWrapper(utils.BaseEncoder, TransformerMixin):
    """Extend supervised encoders to n-class labels, where n >= 2.

    The label can be numerical (e.g.: 0, 1, 2, 3,...,n), string or categorical (pandas.Categorical).
    The label is first encoded into n-1 binary columns. Subsequently, the inner supervised encoder
    is executed for each binarized label.

    The names of the encoded features are suffixed with underscore and the corresponding class name
    (edge scenarios like 'dog'+'cat_frog' vs. 'dog_cat'+'frog' are not currently handled).

    The implementation is experimental and the API may change in the future.
    The order of the returned features may change in the future.

class NestedCVWrapper(utils.BaseEncoder, TransformerMixin):
    """
    Extends supervised encoders with the nested cross validation on the training data to minimise overfitting.

    For a validation or a test set, supervised encoders can be used as follows:

        X_train_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
        X_valid_encoded = encoder.transform(X_valid)

    However, the downstream model will be overfitting to the encoded training data due to target leakage.
    Using out-of-fold encodings is an effective way to prevent target leakage. This is equivalent to:

        X_train_encoded = np.zeros(X.shape)
        for trn, val in kfold.split(X, y):
            encoder.fit(X[trn], y[trn])
            X_train_encoded[val] = encoder.transform(X[val])

    This can be used in place of the "inner folds" as discussed here:
        https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/evaluate-a-model.html

    See README.md for a list of supervised encoders.

    Discussion: Although leave-one-out encoder internally performs leave-one-out cross-validation, it is
    actually the most overfitting supervised model in our library. To illustrate the issue, let's imagine we
    have a totally unpredictive nominal feature and a perfectly balanced binary label. A supervised encoder
    should encode the feature into a constant vector as the feature is unpredictive of the label. But when we
    use leave-one-out cross-validation, the label ratio cease to be perfectly balanced and the wrong class
    label always becomes the majority in the training fold. Leave-one-out encoder returns a seemingly
    predictive feature. And the downstream model starts to overfit to the encoded feature. Unfortunately,
    even 10-fold cross-validation is not immune to this effect:
        http://www.kdd.org/exploration_files/v12-02-4-UR-Perlich.pdf
    To decrease the effect, it is recommended to use a low count of the folds. And that is the reason why
    this wrapper uses 5 folds by default.

    Based on the empirical results, only LeaveOneOutEncoder benefits greatly from this wrapper. The remaining
    encoders can be used without this wrapper.

    feature_encoder: Object
