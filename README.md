Categorical Encoding Methods
============================

A set of example problems examining different encoding methods for categorical variables for the purpose of 
classification. Optionally, install the library of encoders as a package and use them in your projects directly.  They 
are all available as methods or as scikit-learn compatible transformers. 

Encoding Methods
----------------

 * Ordinal
 * One-Hot
 * Binary
 * Helmert Contrast
 * Sum Contrast
 * Polynomial Contrast
 * Backward Difference Contrast
 * Simple Hashing

Usage
-----

Either run the exampels in encoding_examples.py, or install as:

    pip install git+https://github.com/wdm0006/categorical_encoding.git

Datasets
--------

The datasets used in these examples are car, mushroom, and splice datasets from the UCI dataset repository, found here:
