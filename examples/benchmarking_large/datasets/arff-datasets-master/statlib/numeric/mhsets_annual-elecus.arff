%  VERSIONS
%    This is version 1.0.
%    It is intended to maintain updates and/or corrections to these datasets.
%  These updates and corrections are available by anonymous ftp from
%  fisher.stats.uwo.ca in the directory pub/mhsets.
%    Both shar (for unix) and zip (for PC) archives are available by
%  anonymous ftp from fisher.stats.uwo.ca in the directory pub/mhsets.
% 
%  OVERVIEW OF THE DATASETS
%    The datasets provided include many of the datasets dicussed in our
%  book, Hipel and McLeod (1994). In our book we also mention a number of
%  case studies conducted by ourselves as well as other researchers. Many of
%  these datasets are also available here too. Other datasets which are
%  suitable for use in the problems which accompany the book or for
%  time series researchers wishing to compare their methodology to
%  other interesting types of data. In our time series and systems
%  courses, the datasets provided here are a useful and extensive
%  source of both classroom demonstrations and student projects and
%  assignments.
%    All datasets are in the public domain.
% 
%  FORMAT OF THE DATASETS
%    The data sets are organized in a number of subdirectories. Some of
%  subdirectories refer to particular case studies such as ASKEW and NOAKES
%  while other subdirectories group datasets of a similar type such as ANNUAL
%  and ECOLOGY.
%    Each dataset consists of a title plus a time series in free-format in
%  chronlogical order reading across. The extension .1 or .2 means that there
%  is one or two data series on the file. Sometimes there are additional
%  comments located immediately after the title. These comments are indicated
%  by a symbol # in column 1 of the file. This format is read directly
%  by our MHTS decision support package. For convenience of S or S-plus
%  users, a S function is provided to input these datasets into S or S-plus.
%  See the section, USING THE DATASETS WITH S/SPLUS, below.
% 
% 
%  SCOPE OF THE BOOK
%    This unique book provides a comprehensive presentation of the theory and
%  practice of time series modelling of environmental systems.
%  Recent and useful developments in time series analysis, stochastic hydrology
%  and statistical water quality modelling are combined in a coherent and
%  systematic manner in order to produce this landmark book on time series
%  methods in environmetrics.
%    The rich variety of time series models that are clearly defined,
%  explained and illustrated include ARMA, nonstationary ARIMA,
%  long memory FARMA, seasonal ARIMA, deseasonalized, periodic,
%  transfer function) noise, intervention and multivariate ARMA models.
%  Extensive hydrological, water quality and other environmental applications
%  are given for clearly demonstrating how the various kinds of time series
%  models can be systematically and conveniently fitted to real world data sets
%  by following the identification, estimation and diagnostic check stages of
%  model construction. Moreover, a major emphasis of the book is the use of
%  exploratory data analysis graphs, intervention analysis, nonparametric
%  trend tests and regression analysis in the detection and estimation of
%  trends in environmental impact assessment studies.
%    Other topics in environmetrics covered in the book include
%  time series analysis in decision making, estimating missing observations,
%  simulation, the Hurst phenomenon, forecasting experiments and causality.
% 
%    Professionals working in fields overlapping with environmetrics who will
%  find this book to be an indispensable resource include water resources
%  engineers, environmental scientists, hydrologists, geophysicists,
%  geographers, earth scientists and planners.
%  However, because the time series methods presented in the book can be
%  applied to data sets arising in fields outside of the environmental areas
%  described in the book, other professionals such as systems scientists,
%  economists, mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, and management
%  scientists will benefit from a knowledge of the impressive array of ideas
%  given in the book.
%    Within each professional group, the book is designed for use by teachers,
%  students, researchers, practitioners and consultants.
%    When employed for teaching purposes, this book can be used as a course text
%  at the upper undergraduate and graduate levels.
%  The only mathematical background required of the reader is a one
%  semester introductory course on probability and statistics.
%  Depending upon the number of topics covered, the book can be utilized in a
%  one ortwo semester course.
% 
%  DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM
%    The McLeod - Hipel Time Series (MHTS) constitutes a comprehensive decision
%  support system for performing extensive data analyses using many of the
%  time series models, graphical procedures, trend tests and other techniques
%  described in the aforementioned book and elsewhere.
%  To obtain information about the MHTS package, kindly contact A. I. McLeod
%  (aim@uwo.ca) or K. W. Hipel (519) 885-1211.
% 
%  USING THE DATASETS WITH S/SPLUS
%    An S function is provided for inputing the datasets into S/Splus.
%  The source code is in the file readmhts.s and S style documentation
%  is available in readmhts.d. These two files are included in the
%  archive directly under the main subdirectory mhsets.
%     To read this function into S/Splus:  source("readmhts.s")
%     Then to read in a particular dataset, say amazon.2, into the S variable,
%  z enter:   z_readmhts("annual/amazon.2")

% ECOLOGY
% Time series data on the abundance of various wild animals. Typically
% these data show strong cyclically behaviour which has been the subject
% for speculation and study. Basically there are two types of counts -
% fur production and fur sales. The difference is that fur sales as
% a one year lag over fur production. The type is indicated in the time
% series title string.

% LONDONWQ
%  The water consumption data and the number of consumers are obtained
% by meter readers. Approximately half of all consumers have their meter
% read in a given month. The data for residential water consumption
% is the consumption for those residential consumers who had their meter
% read in the given month for the last two months. This is considered
% a proxy variable for the total residential water consumption.
% 
%  Prior to January 1991 the rates for residential water consumption in the
% city of London were based on a descending block structure.
% So the more water one used, the cheaper the rate.
% For example in 1983, the first 200 cubic feet were
% charged at $3.80 per 100 cubic feet, the next 50000 cubic feet were charged
% at $0.64 per cubic feet;
% and the remainder was charged at $0.53 per cubic feet.
% In January of 1991 the billing was changed to encourage conservation.
% The new rate is based on an increasing block rate structure.
% For example in 1991, the first 1200 cubic
% feet consumed by residential users were charged at $2.011 per 100 cubic feet,
% the next 2800 cubic feet were charged at $2.120 per 100 cubic feet, and the
% remainder was charged at $2.228 per 100 cubic feet.
% From June 1993 onwards,
% the environmental tax was added to the bill of water consumption, this tax
% rate charges of $0.254 per 100 cubic feet.
